$SCRIPT_NAME - Copyright (c) 2014-2022 R. Diez - Licensed under the GNU AGPLv3

Overview:

This script builds/runs/etc. the DebugDue project. You would normally run
the script from your development environment (Emacs, Vim, Eclipse, ...).

Syntax:
  $SCRIPT_NAME <switches...>

Information switches:
 --help     Displays this help text.
 --license  Prints license information.

All steps below are optional. The step number gives the order in which
the steps are run if requested.

Step 1, clean operation and configuration options:
  --clean  Deletes the -obj and -bin directories for the given build type
           and the 'configure' script, if they exist, so that the
           next build will start from scratch.
  --enable-configure-cache  Enables the cache file when invoking
           autoconf's 'configure' script. This will save some time
           when rebuilding from scratch.
           You should not use a cache file if you are changing configure.ac
           or some other autoconf source file in this project. You should also
           drop the cache after changing your system's configuration,
           such as after installing a new software package.
           The local cache file (if any) will be dropped if you run this script
           without enabling the cache.
  --configure-cache-filename="filename"
           This option triggers --enable-configure-cache, but, instead
           of using a local cache file, the given one will be used.
           The caller is then responsible for the lifetime of the supplied
           cache file, as this script will never drop it.
  --enable-ccache   Uses 'ccache', which can possibly reduce compilation times.
                    You can only enable ccache when configuring the project
                    for the first time (or after cleaning it).
                    There are also some caveats, see this script's source code
                    for details about ccache.

Step 2, build operations:
  --build    Runs "make" for the default target. Generates the autoconf
             files beforehand if necessary.
  --atmel-software-framework="<path>"  Directory where the ASF is installed.
                                       Only needed if the project requires it.
  --show-build-commands  Show the full compilation commands during the build.
  --disassemble  Generate extra information files from the just-built ELF file:
                 complete disassembly, list of objects sorted by size,
                 sorted list of strings (with 'strings' command), readelf dump.
  --make-arg=ARG  Pass an extra argument to 'make'. This is primarily intended
                  for make variables. For example: --make-arg CPPFLAGS=-Dmysymbol=1
                  You can specify --make-arg several times.
  --build-output-base-dir="<path>"  Where the build output will land.
                                    Defaults to '$DEFAULT_BUILD_OUTPUT_BASE_SUBDIR'.

  The default is not to build anything. If you then debug your firmware,
  make sure that the existing binary matches the code on the target.
  That is, do not forget to program it first on the target.

Step 3, program operations:
  --program-over-jtag  Transfers the firmware over JTAG to the target device.
  --program-with-bossac  Transfers the firmware with 'bossac' to the target device.
  --verify  After programming, verify that the firmware was written correctly.
  --cache-programmed-file  Programming a new binary takes time. If the binary has not
                           changed, this option skips programming.
                           Warning: This assumes exclusive access to a single device.
                           If some other tool reprograms the Arduino Due, or it
                           is swapped out for a different Arduino Due, it will confuse
                           the build script. In this case, either re-run without
                           this option or delete the cached binary file to force
                           reprogramming.
  --path-to-bossac="path/to/bossac"  The default is "bossac", which only works
                                     if is is on the PATH. Under Ubuntu/Debian,
                                     the package to install is called 'bossa-cli'.
  --debug-adapter=xxx  What debug adapter to use:
                       DebugDue, Flyswatter2 or Olimex-ARM-USB-OCD-H.

Step 4, debug operations:
  --debug  Starts the firmware under the debugger (GDB connected to
           OpenOCD over JTAG).
  --debugger-type="<type>"  Debugger types are "gdb" and "ddd" (a graphical
                            interface to GDB).
  --debug-from-the-start  Breaks as soon as possible after starting the firmware.
  --add-breakpoint="function name or line position like Main.cpp:123"
  --openocd-path="openocd-0.10.0/bin/openocd"  Path to the OpenOCD executable.

Global options:
  --project="<project name>"  Specify 'DebugDue' (the default), 'EmptyFirmware' or 'QemuFirmware'.
  --toolchain-dir="<path>"
  --build-type="<type>"  Build types are "debug" and "release".

Examples:
  First of all, you may want to edit routine user_config() in this script
  in order to set the default options according to your system.
  This way, you do not have to specify any global configuration switches
  on each run.

  Every time you make a change in the source code, you would normally run:
    $SCRIPT_NAME --build --build-type="debug"

  At some point in time, you want to debug your firmware with:
    $SCRIPT_NAME --build --build-type="debug" --program-over-jtag --debug

Exit status: 0 means success. Any other value means error.

      # compilation, so pressure increases on the system's disk cache.

      # your application's build script. And you are always using the same compiler.

  # Unfortunately, Bash does not provide a timeout option for the 'wait' command, or any other

  #
  # In order to check whether a child process is still alive, we could use something like this:
  #
  #   kill -0 "$CHILD_PID"
  #
  # However, that is unreliable, because the system can reuse PIDs at any point in time.
  # Using a Bash job spec like this does not help either:
  #
  #   kill -0 %123
  #
  # The trouble is, the internal job table is apparently not updated in non-interactive shells
  # until you execute a 'jobs' command. If the job has finished, attempting to reference
  # its job spec will succeed only once the next time around. The job spec will then be dropped,
  # and any subsequence reference to it will fail, in the best case, or will reference
  # some other later job in the worst scenario.
  #
  # Furthermore, parsing the output from 'jobs' is not easy either. Here are some examples:
  #
  #  [1]+  Done                    my command
  #  [2]-  Done(1)                 my command

  #  [5]   Stopped                 my command
  #  [6]   Killed                  my command
  #  [7]   Terminated              my command
  #  [8]   User defined signal 1   my command
  #  [9]   Profiling timer expired my command
  #
  # '+' means it is the "current" job. '-' means it is the "previous" job.
  # 'Done' means an exit code of 0. 'Done(1)' means the process terminated with an exit status of 1.
  # 'Terminated' means SIGTERM, 'Killed' means SIGKILL, 'User defined signal 1' means SIGUSR1,
  # and 'Profiling timer expired' menas SIGPROF.
  #
  # All of the above is from empirical testing. As far as I can see, it is not documented.
  # Therefore, I assume that it can change in any future version. Those messages could
  # for example be translated in non-English locales.
  #
  # Therefore, attempting to parse the ouput is not a good idea.
  #
  # The workaround I have implemented is as follows: if 'jobs %n' fails, the job is not running
  # anymore, and the reason why not was reported in the last successful invocation of 'jobs %n'.
  # The downside is that the caller will realise that the job has finished on the next call

  # What we want to do is actually pretty straightforward:
  #
  # 1) Start OpenOCD.
  # 2) Wait until OpenOCD is ready to accept a GDB connection.
  # 3) Start GDB in a new window.
  # 4) Wait until the user closes GDB.
  # 5) Shutdown OpenOCD.
  #
  # There are all kinds of shortcomings that make this task difficult:
  # a) OpenOCD provides no way to signal when it has initialised the GDB server.
  #    It turns out that GDB retries the TCP connection by default, see GDB commands
  #    "show tcp auto-retry" and "show tcp connect-timeout", so we do not really
  #    have to wait until OpenOCD is ready.
  #    However, synchronising both processes is still desirable for the following reasons:
  #    1) If both processes are synchronised, the first GDB connection attempt will succeed.
  #       Otherwise, any GDB connection retries will waste time: up to 200 ms during
  #       the first second, and up to 1 second afterwards, see POLL_INTERVAL in GDB's source code.
  #    2) If OpenOCD fails to start for whatever reason, it is best to report it and stop,
  #       rather than starting a second concurrent process which will timeout after a while,
  #       or has to be killed when the parent realises that OpenOCD has terminated early.
  # b) OpenOCD cannot shut itself down cleanly when GDB detaches.
  #    There is an event on detach, but shutdown down inside it will break
  #    the closing handshake with GDB and make it error.
  # c) It is very hard to coordinate child processes correctly with Bash.
  #
  # I have posted questions in the OpenOCD and Bash mailing lists to no avail:

  #
  # About the connection speed:
  #   The maximum JTAG speed for this kind of microcontroller is F_CPU/6.
  #   The SAM3X starts at 4 MHz upon reset, so that maximum JTAG speed on start-up is 666 kHz.
  #   However, the standard OpenOCD configuration sets the JTAG speed to 500 kHz,
  #   because the internal oscillator may not be very accurate.
  #   The flash write speed is then around 13 kBytes/s.
  #   We could increase the CPU clock temporarily before flashing the firmware in order to save time.
  #
  #   If the CPU is running at the normal speed of 84 MHz, the maximum JTAG clock would be 14 MHz then.
  #   If the firmware from this project has been programmed already, you can use that maximum speed,
  #   because the firmware increases F_CPU to 84 MHz on start-up before the short pause
  #   for the eventual OpenOCD connection. There are some gotchas though:
  #   - We cannot be sure that the firmware has actually increased the CPU clock.
  #   - We are resetting now with software (instead of with the hardware SRST signal),
  #     so the firmware will not run at all upon reset.
  #
  #   Note that high speeds may not be reliable, especially if you use non-professional cables.
  #   You can use command-line option '--verify' (at the cost of a short extra delay)
  #   to make sure that you can trust your setup.
  #   Speeds over 10 MHz do not really bring any advantage, as the Flash memory becomes then the bottleneck.

# We are using here external tool 'bc' because Bash does not support floating-point numbers.
# It is possible to write a pure-Bash implementation with a precision to the hundredth of a second,
# but, if you are not careful, 32-bit versions of Bash could fail if the uptime is greater than 248 days.
# I could not find the time to write such a careful implementation.
#
# Apparently, bc's variable 'scale' only works with division, for other operations the displayed precision
# will depend on the operands. That is the reason why the result is divided by 1 at the end.
#
# At this point, we could try to find out the integer width of the current Bash version
# and check that bc's result does not overflow it. If you have the time to implement it,
# please drop me a line.
