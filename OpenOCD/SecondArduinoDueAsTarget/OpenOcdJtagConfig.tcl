# ---- Reset configuration ----

# - The Arduino Due provides just a SRST signal (called JTAG_RESET / MASTER-RESET), so the right setting is 'srst_only'.
#
# - I have tested empirically that no JTAG communication can take place while the JTAG_SRST signal is asserted.
#   This is why we need setting 'srst_gates_jtag' and 'connect_deassert_srst'.
#
#   This is unfortunate. It is the reason why the firmware makes a pause on start-up, so that OpenOCD
#   can connect before the firmware goes too far.
#   Some chips, like STM32 and STR9, handle reset better, so they can use settings
#   'srst_nogate' and 'connect_assert_srst' instead.
#
#   However, I do not think that JTAG_SRST just gates the JTAG clock, I think that the whole JTAG logic is reset.
#   That is why we need 'srst_pulls_trst'. Without this option, OpenOCD v0.10.0 and v0.11.0 prints extra errors like:
#     Error: Invalid ACK (7) in DAP response
#   Afterwards, the connection does not work well with OpenOCD v0.10.0. However, OpenOCD v0.11.0
#   seems more robust and the connection still works.
#
# - The SRST signal has a 100 K pull-up resistor, so the right JTAG adapter driver setting is then 'srst_open_drain'.
#   Otherwise, if the debug adapter actively holds SRST high most of the time, the ATmega16U2 AVR microcontroller
#   may no longer be able to trigger a reset when you connect to the 'Programming' USB serial port.
#
# - The default configuration is "reset_config  none  separate". With that configuration, OpenOCD connects
#   to the microcontroller without any errors or warnings. The trouble is, it does not reset the
#   microcontroller's peripherals upon connecting. As a result, if the firmware has run before, the USB peripheral
#   will not work correctly anymore, so the "native USB port" will keep retring to connect,
#   and the heartbeat LED will not blink. That is, the firmware will not operate correctly.
#   Command "cortex_m reset_config sysresetreq" should be able to reset the peripherals,
#   but it does not seem to work, see below for more details.
#
# - With OpenOCD v0.10.0, if you stop the firmware with GDB and then restart debugging, you get these messages:
#     GDB attached to OpenOCD, halting the CPU...
#     undefined debug reason 7 - target needs reset
#   With OpenOCD v0.11.0, the debug reason is '8' instead of '7', but otherwise it is the same.
#   Afterwards, the connection appears to work well.
#
# - With OpenOCD v0.11.0, you get the following errors consistently, whether the firmware was stopped or not:
#     Error: Debug regions are unpowered, an unexpected reset might have happened
#     Error: JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
#     Error: Could not find MEM-AP to control the core
#   However, debugging seems fine afterwards.

# I have used the SRST hardware signal to reset the Arduino Due for years with OpenOCD
# versions 0.10.0 and 0.11.0, but something has changed in version 0.12.0, and it does not work anymore.
# Instead of further researching the cause, I have decided to try switching to a software-triggered reset.
# From the OpenOCD documentation:
# "(For Cortex-M targets, this is not necessary. The target driver knows how to use trigger an NVIC reset when SRST is not available.)"
# The advantage of this method is that you can debug from the very beginning,
# and you do not need a pause in the Firmware start-up code in order to give OpenOCD enough time to connect
# and be able to debug from the beginning.

    #    cannot be reset and halted. The target, after reset is released begins to execute code.
